need a developer blog plartrform that i can be able to write and publish my bloggs from
so it is my very own personal so no need to complicte things here just a simple welcoming dashboard display to begin with
"new blog" section where when clicked, it opens up a "canvas" to wtite my blog
CANVAS: able to upload image--reference url of the blog and also other images as an illustration in the blog articles
        title
        sutitle
the second part of the plartfornm is a place where i can have like a portfolio like description of my projects
-here i want it to be aplace to have image, video, tutorial, and descriptions of my projects i guess this will work the same as the blog only differ a bit

SO THIS IS THE MAIN DEVELOPMENT
ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE, (THE REAL SYSYTEM)
        -Hosting of this plartform
        -DATABASE to store the content
        -other resources consumed
LIKE PUBLISHING THE BLOGS ON THE NET TO LINK THIS UP TO THE MY PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
